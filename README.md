# 🐍 Python AI Assistant with Streamlit and LLaMA 3

This is an interactive Python-based AI assistant built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and the [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) framework, powered by the **LLaMA 3** model via Ollama. It allows users to ask Python programming questions and get clear, beginner-friendly, production-grade answers — with a strong focus on clarity, security, performance, and completeness.
